## What’s the Dual Mining Feature?

FateX’s dual mining lets you convert your Grow project voting power (Votes) into stakeable assets in FateX’s pool, mining Fate tokens as rewards. In short, your Grow votes not only back projects but also generate extra income on FateX. It’s a win-win—supporting the Grow ecosystem while pocketing Fate tokens!

## How to Use the Dual Mining Feature?

### 1. Update Your Voting Power
- **Prerequisite**: You need to vote in the Grow project (default project: “fatex”).
- On FateX, head to the “Dual Mining” page and click “Update Voting Power.”
- The system pulls your Grow votes, converting them into FateX-usable Votes, shown as “Available Voting Power.”

### 2. Stake Your Votes
- On the “Dual Mining” page, check your “Available Voting Power.”
- Hit the “Stake” button to deposit all available Votes into the pool.
- Once staked, your Votes shift from “Available” to “Staked,” kicking off Fate token mining.

### 3. Harvest Rewards
- Return to the “Dual Mining” page anytime and click “Harvest” to claim your mined Fate tokens.
- Rewards stack up based on your staked amount and time, landing in your account after harvesting.

### 4. Unstake
- Want to stop mining? Click “Unstake.”
- Your Votes return as “Available Voting Power,” and all unclaimed Fate rewards are paid out simultaneously.

## Dual Mining Reward Rules

### Reward Source
- The FateX staking pool, set by admins, holds **3.6 billion Fate** (3,600,000,000 Fate) for a **180-day** mining cycle.
- Daily rewards total **20,000,000 Fate** (20M Fate/day), released evenly per second.

### Personal Reward Calculation
- Your rewards hinge on:
  - **Staked Votes**: Your Votes as a share of the pool’s total staked Votes.
  - **Staking Time**: Measured from your last harvest or stake—longer means more rewards.
- Simple Formula: Your Reward = (Your Staked Votes ÷ Total Staked Votes) × Fate Released in Time Period.
- Example: If total staked Votes are 10,000 and you stake 1,000, you’d earn 20,000,000 × (1,000 ÷ 10,000) = **2,000,000 Fate/day**.

### NFT Boosts
- Holding a FateX user NFT bumps up your mining rewards.
- Boost percentage ties to your NFT’s “staking weight.” E.g., a 20% boost lifts 2,000,000 Fate/day to **2,400,000 Fate/day**.

### Mining Cycle
- The cycle runs **180 days** from pool start to end.
- Post-cycle, unclaimed rewards calculate up to the end date—mining stops after that.

## Things to Note

1. **Voting Power Requirement**
   - Only Grow project votes count for staking—sync them via “Update Voting Power.”
   - Zero available Votes? No staking possible.

2. **Staking Status**
   - Staked Votes lock into the pool until unstaked.
   - Harvest rewards before unstaking to avoid missing out.

3. **Pool Status**
   - Staking and mining only work when the pool is “active” and within the 180-day window.
   - Post-180 days, users can claim remaining rewards but can’t add new stakes.

4. **Reward Cap**
   - Total rewards won’t exceed **3.6 billion Fate**—fully mined out in 180 days.
