## What’s the Lottery Feature?

FateX’s lottery is a luck-based reward system where you can win varying levels of Fate tokens. It comes in two flavors: **Check-in Lottery (Free)** and **Paid Lottery (Using Fate Tokens)**. Each draw offers a chance at a grand prize, second prize, or third prize, and stacking entries can even unlock special bonuses! Plus, daily limits keep it strategic and fair.

## How to Use the Lottery Feature?

### 1. Get Lottery Chances
You can score lottery entries in two ways:

- **Check-in (Free)**
  Complete 7 consecutive days of check-ins on FateX to earn 1 free lottery chance. See details in the [Check-in Feature Guide](check-in.md).
- **Paid Entry**
  Use a set amount of Fate tokens to join the lottery directly—costs vary based on the prize pool (see “Paid Lottery Costs” below).

### 2. Join the Lottery
- **Check-in Lottery**
  - Head to the “Lottery” page on FateX.
  - If you’ve got a check-in chance, hit “Claim Weekly Lottery” to start.
- **Paid Lottery**
  - On the “Lottery” page, select “Draw with Fate Tokens.” The system deducts the cost from your account and kicks off the draw.
- **Daily Cap**
  - You’re limited to **50 draws per day** (check-in + paid combined). Hit the cap? Wait for the next reset.
- Results pop up instantly, and winning Fate tokens land in your account on the spot.

### 3. Stack Entries for Big Rewards
- Every draw (free or paid) adds to your total entry count.
- Hit **10 total draws**, and click “Claim Special Reward” to cash in a fixed bonus of **1000 Fate**!
- After claiming, your draw count drops by 10, and you start building again.

## Lottery Reward Rules

### Prize Tiers
FateX lottery offers three prize levels, with each draw randomly picking a winner:

- **Grand Prize**: 1000 Fate
  Win Chance: 5%
- **Second Prize**: 500 Fate
  Win Chance: 25%
- **Third Prize**: 150 Fate
  Win Chance: 70%

**Note**: Odds are weighted—5% Grand, 25% Second, 70% Third, totaling 100%.

### Paid Lottery Costs
- A single paid draw costs Fate tokens based on the prize pool’s average:
  - Average Cost = (1000 × 5 + 500 × 25 + 150 × 70) ÷ 100 = **355 Fate**
  - Got a FateX user NFT? Enjoy a discount based on its perks (e.g., 10% off drops it to ~**319.5 Fate**).

### NFT Boosts
- Owning a FateX NFT cuts your paid lottery costs via the “lottery discount” perk.
- Example: 20% discount slashes 355 Fate to **284 Fate**—better bang for your buck!

### Special Reward
- Rack up **10 draws** (free or paid), and claim a guaranteed **1000 Fate** bonus.
- Claiming deducts 10 from your total draw count, resetting the cycle.

### Daily Draw Limit
- Max **50 draws per day** per user.
- Resets daily at 00:00 (system time), so you’re back in action the next day.

## Things to Note

1. **Chance Sources**
   - Check-in lottery requires 7 straight days—miss one, and you restart.
   - Paid lottery needs enough Fate tokens in your account to play.

2. **Daily Limit**
   - 50 draws max per day (free + paid). Hit it, and you’re locked out until tomorrow.

3. **Cost Burn**
   - Fate tokens spent on paid draws are burned (destroyed), reducing supply and boosting value.

4. **Instant Rewards**
   - Winnings drop straight into your account—no manual claiming needed.

5. **Track Your Count**
   - Check “Lottery History” for your total and daily draw counts to claim that 10-draw bonus on time.
