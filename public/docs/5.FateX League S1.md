## FateX League S1 Reward Rules

### Leaderboard Airdrop Rewards
- **GROW Reward Pool (Dynamic)**: Scales with total Grow votes network-wide:
  - ≤ 1B Grow Votes: 5% (e.g., 1B = 50M GROW)
  - 1B-2B: 6% (e.g., 2B = 120M GROW)
  - 2B-3B: 7%
  - 3B-4B: 8%
  - 4B-5B: 9% (e.g., 5B = 450M GROW)
  - > 5B: Fixed 9%
- **Allocation**:
  - Rewards blend Grow votes and burned Fate with weights:
    1. **Grow Share** = (Your Grow Votes ÷ Total Grow Votes)
    2. **Fate Share** = (Your Burned Fate ÷ Total Burned Fate)
    3. **Combined Share** = (Grow Share × Grow Weight + Fate Share × Fate Weight)
    4. Your GROW = Combined Share ÷ Sum of All Users’ Combined Shares × GROW Pool
  - **Weights**: Grow + Fate weights total 100%, set by admins (e.g., 70% Grow + 30% Fate).
  - Example:
    - Network: 2B Grow votes, 100K Fate burned, 120M GROW pool, 70% Grow + 30% Fate.
    - User A: 200M Grow votes, 1,000 Fate burned.
    - Grow Share = (200M ÷ 2B) = 10%, Fate Share = (1,000 ÷ 100K) = 1%.
    - Combined Share = (10% × 70% + 1% × 30%) = 7% + 0.3% = **7.3%**.
    - If total shares sum to 100%, User A gets: 120M × 7.3% ≈ **8.76M GROW**.
- **Claim Time**: Open after the event ends, one claim per user.
