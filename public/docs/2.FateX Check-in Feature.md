## Things to Note

1. **One Check-in Per Day**
   - Check-ins are daily only—repeat clicks won’t stack rewards.
   - See “Checked in Today”? Come back tomorrow!
2. **Streak Timing**
   - The system uses timestamps to track “next day” status—check in on time to avoid breaking your streak.
3. **NFT Boosts**
   - Holding a FateX NFT? Your check-in rewards auto-adjust with a bonus (e.g., 20% boost turns 150 Fate into 180 Fate).
4. **Reward Delivery**
   - Check-in rewards land straight in your account—no manual claiming needed.

- **Growing Gains**: Stick with it, and rewards climb to 500 Fate/day.
